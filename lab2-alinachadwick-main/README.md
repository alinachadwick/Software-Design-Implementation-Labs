## CS50 Spring 2021, Lab 2

GitHub username: alinachadwick

This lab consists of three major components:
chill: A program that created tables of wind chill values based on inputs of temperature and velocity.
words: A program that splits up text in files or in stdin, one word per line.
histo: Interactively creates a histogram based on user input of numerical values (positive integers).

Specific tests are included for each component.
In each subdirectory, there is a testing.sh file that outlines the tests and a testing.out file that provides the results.
